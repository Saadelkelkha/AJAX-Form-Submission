# AJAX-Form-Submission
This a web application demonstrating asynchronous form submission using AJAX with jQuery. It features a simple HTML form collecting user information (name, first name, age) and sending it to a PHP script. The script processes and saves the data to a JSON file, dynamically updating the web page to display the submitted information without reloading.
